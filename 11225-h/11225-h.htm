<h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

<p>The huge waterspout observed off
Guernsey last week "travelling towards
France" is believed to have been
making for the Peace Conference.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The Captain of a Wilson liner on
being torpedoed ate his pocket-book to
prevent his sailing instructions from
falling into the hands of the Germans.
The report that the ex-Kaiser has whiled
away the time at Amerongen by chewing
up three copies of the German White
Book and one of Prince LICHNOWSKY'S
Memoirs is probably a variant of this story.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"Our chief hope of control of influenza," writes Sir ARTHUR
NEWSHOLME of the Local Government Board, "lies in further
investigation." Persons who insist upon having influenza
between now and Easter will do so at their own risk.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Writing to a provincial paper a correspondent asks when Mr.
PHILIP SNOWDEN was born. Other people are content to ask "Why?"</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"We think it prudent to speak with moderation on all subjects,"
says <i>The Morning Post</i>. There now!</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>We mentioned last week the startling rumour that a Civil
Servant had been seen running, and a satisfactory explanation
has now been issued. It appears that the gentleman in
question was going off duty.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>According to the <i>Malin</i>, the Bavarian PREMIER told a newspaper
man that the Bavarian revolution cost exactly eighteen
shillings. This seems to lend colour to the
rumour that Dr. EISNER picked this revolution up second-hand in Russia.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"Springfield and Napsbury Lunatic
Asylums," says a news item, "are to
be known in future as mental hospitals."
Government institutions which have
hitherto borne that title will in the
future be known simply as "Departments."</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A German sailor, who is described as
"twenty-seven, 6 ft. 9½ in.," has escaped
from Dorchester camp. A reward has
been offered for information leading to
the recapture of any part of him.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The servant question is admittedly
acute, but whether sufficiently so to
justify the attitude of a contemporary,
which deals with the subject under the
sinister title, "Maxims for Mistresses,"
is open to doubt.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The case of the North Country workman who voluntarily abandoned his
unemployment grant in order to take a job is attributed to a morbid craze for
notoriety.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>As a result of the engineers' strike and the failure of the heating apparatus,
we understand that Government officials in Whitehall have spent several
sleepless days.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>We gather that the mine reported to have been washed up at Bognor turns
out to be an obsolete 1914 pork pie&mdash;but fortunately the pin had been
removed.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><i>The Daily Express</i> tells us that a crowd of new monkeys have arrived at
the Zoo. We are pleased to note this, because several of the monkeys there
were certainly the worse for wear.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A contemporary anticipates a boom
in very light motor cars at a hundred and
thirty pounds each. They are said to
be just the thing to carry in the tool-box
in case of a breakdown.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A sensation has been caused in
Scotland, says <i>The National News</i>, by
the passing of a number of counterfeit
Treasury notes. As we go to press we
learn that most of the victims are going
on as well as can be expected, though
recovery is naturally slow.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Mr. WILLIAM LE QUEUX is said to
be very much annoyed at the wicked
way in which Russia has been
appropriated by other writers.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Much regret is felt at the news that
the recent outbreak of Jazz music is
not to be dealt with at the Peace
Conference.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Is gallantry dying out? We ask
because <i>Tit Bits</i> has an article
entitled, "Women Burglars."
We may be old-fashioned, but
surely it should be "Lady Burglars."</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>On the last day for investing
in National War Bonds, a
patriotic subaltern was heard
at Cox's asking if his overdraft
could be transferred to these
securities.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"The market price of radium
to-day," says a Continental
journal, "is £345,000 an ounce." In
order to avert waste and deterioration,
purchasers are advised
to store the stuff in barrels in
a large dry cellar.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Mr. Punch does not wish to
boast unduly of his unique
qualities, but up to the time of
going to press he had made no
offer for Drury Lane Theatre.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>In view of the recent newspaper
articles on spiritualism,
several prominent persons are
about to announce that they
have decided not to grant any
interviews after death.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Liverpool Licensing Justices have
urged the Liquor Control Board to take
steps to prevent the drinking of methylated
spirits by women. It is suggested
that distillers should be compelled to
give their whisky a distinctive flavour.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"A box of cigarettes was all that
burglars took from the Theatre Royal,
Aldershot," says a news item. There
is something magnificently arrogant
about that "all."</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"Saying 'Thank you' to a customer,"
says a news item, "a Wallasey butcher
fell unconscious." In our neighbourhood
it used to be, until quite lately,
the customer who fell unconscious.</p>

<h2>THE CAREER.</h2>

<p>My dear James,&mdash;Ere long the military
machine will be able to spare one
of its cogs&mdash;myself. Yes, James, soon
you will once again see me in my silk
hat, cerise fancy vest and brown boots
(among other garments). I think I
shall have brass buttons on all my
coats for the sheer joy of seeing them
without let or hindrance grow green
from lack of polish. I shall once again
train my hair in graceful curling strands
under (respectively) the south-east and
south-west corners of my ears. If I
meet my Brigadier in the street I shall
notice him or not just according to
my whim of the moment. But, James,
I shall have to work for my living.
There's the rub.</p>

<p>I must say the Army tries to help
one. Somebody or other has issued a
whole schedule of civil occupations to
assist me in my choice of a career. It
offers an embarrassment of riches.</p>

<p>Take the "A's." I was momentarily
attracted by <i>Air Balloon Maker</i>.
It sounds a joyous job. Think of the
delight of sending forth these delicate
nothings inflated and perfect. My only
fear is that I should destroy the fruits
of my own labour. One touch of my
rough hands is always inimical to an
air-balloon. And if you know of any
more depressing sight than a collapsed
air-balloon, all moist and incapable of
resurrection, for heaven's sake keep it
to yourself.</p>

<p><i>Allowance Man</i> (<i>brewing</i>) sounds
hopeful. My only question is: Does
an <i>Allowance Man</i> (<i>brewing</i>) fix his
own allowance (brewed)?</p>

<p>Am I slightly knock-kneed or am I
not? Do write me frankly on the
subject. You have seen me divested
of trousers. Because if I am then I
don't think I will try my luck as an
<i>Artist's Model</i>.</p>

<p><i>Athlete</i>.&mdash;Ha! I feel my biceps and
find it not so soft. It's a wearing life,
though. Is there such a thing as an
<i>Athlete</i> (<i>indoor</i>)? You know my speed
and agility at Ludo.</p>

<p>I flatter myself I have musical taste,
but <i>Back and Belly Maker</i> (<i>piano</i>) I
consider vulgar&mdash;almost indecent, in
fact. Such anatomical intimacy with
the piano would destroy for me the
bewitchment of the Moonlight Sonata.</p>

<p>There is something very alluring
about <i>Bank Note Printer</i>. I see the
chance of continuing the Army trick of
making a living without working for it.
Surely a <i>Bank Note Printer</i> is allowed
his little perquisites. Why should he
print millions of bank notes for other
people and none for himself? I can
imagine an ill-used <i>Bank Note Printer</i>
very easily becoming a Bolshevist.</p>

<p><i>Barb Maker</i> (<i>wire</i>) I do not like. I
have too many unpleasant memories of
the Somme. It is a hideous trade and
ought to be abolished altogether.</p>

<p>If I am wrong correct me, but isn't
the prime function of a <i>Bargee</i> to swear
incessantly? Not my forte, James.
What you thought you heard that day
in 1911, when I missed a six-inch putt,
was only "Yam," which is a Thibetan
expression meaning "How dreadfully
unfortunate!" I knew a Major once&mdash;but
that's for another article.</p>

<p>Beneath the heading "Bat" I find
<i>Bat Maker</i> (<i>brick</i>) and <i>Bat Maker</i>
(<i>tennis</i>). Under which king, James?
Anyway, I hate a man who talks about
a "tennis bat." He would probably
call football shorts "knickers."</p>

<p>I am favourably inclined towards
<i>Bathing Machine Attendant</i> (why not
<i>Bathing Mechanic</i>, for short?) What
a grand affair to ride old Dobbin into
the seething waves and pretend he was
a sea-serpent! Confidentially, there
are lots of people to whose bathing-machines
I would give an extra push
when I had unlimbered their vehicles
and turned Dobbin's nose again towards
the cliffs of Albion.</p>

<p>My pleasure in stirring things with a
ladle nearly decided me to train as a
<i>Bean Boiler</i>; but I fear the monotony.
Nothing but an endless succession of
beans, with never a carrot to make a
splash of colour nor an onion to scent
the steamy air. And, James, I have a
friend who is known to all and sundry
as "The Old Bean." Every bean I
was called upon to boil would remind
me of him, whom I would not boil for
worlds.</p>

<p>Here is something extraordinarily
attractive&mdash;<i>Black Pudding Maker</i>. You
know black puddings. I am told that
when you stew them (do not eat them
cold, I implore you!) they give off
ambrosial perfumes, and that after tasting
one you would never again touch <i>pèche
Melba</i>. But as a <i>Black Pudding Maker</i>
should I become nauseated?</p>

<p>Almost next door comes <i>Blood Collector</i>.
Wait while I question the Mess
Cook ... James, I cannot become a
Black Pudding maker. The Mess Cook
tells me that <i>Blood Collector</i> and <i>Black
Pudding Maker</i> are probably allied
trades. How dreadful!</p>

<p>How about <i>Bobber?</i> Does that mean
that I should have to shear my wife's
silken tresses? Cousin Phyllis has
appeared with a tomboy's shock of hair,
and she says it "has only been bobbed."
By a "bobber"? I would like to
wring his neck. But if <i>Bobber</i> has
something to do with those jolly little
things that dance about on cotton
machines (aren't they called "bobbins"?)
I will consider it.</p>

<p>I have not even finished the "B's."
A glance ahead and other enchanting
vistas are revealed. For instance,
<i>Desiccated Soup Maker, Filbert Grower</i>
and (simply) <i>Retired</i>.</p>

<p>This Schedule is splendid in its way,
but why can't they be honest? They
must know that lots of us in our great
national army are in ordinary life just
rogues and vagabonds. The Schedule
ignores such honest tradesmen. How
is a respectable tramp to know when his
group is called for demobilisation if he
is not even given a group? What a
nation of prigs and pretenders we are!</p>

<p>Yours ever, WILLIAM.</p>

<h2>F. E.</h2>

<h4><i>A simple Biographic Recitative based on the Tonic Sol-Fa Note of Mi.</i></h4>

<p>In ante-bellum days, ah me, when I
a stuffman used to be, and proudly
pouched a junior's fee, the <i>Law List</i>
styled me "Smith, F.E." Oh, how
my place seemed small for me; not
that I scorned the stuffman's fee, but
stuffy courts did not agree with me.
I dearly longed to be respiring often,
fresh and free, the breath that was
the life of me, so I became a live M.P.
And, lest the spacious H. of C. should
fail to hold sufficiently the lot of air
respired by me, said I, "A soldier
I will be&mdash;not one of Foot (that's
Infantry), nor yet the reg'lar Cavalry,
for barrack-life will not suit me, yet
ride I must the high gee-gee;" so I
decided straight to be an officer of
Yeomanry. Drilling the troopers on the
lea, the vent I craved for gave to me.
Moreover, on my high gee-gee I learned
what galloping could be.</p>

<p>Those back-bench days! Ah me, ah
me, rude Members christened me "F.E."
And even <i>Punch</i>, in kindly glee, once
on a time, did picture me a prowling
beast, beside the sea, all spotted o'er
with signs, "F.E." That patronymic
thus will be preserved for immortality.
Newspapers, too, I chance to see
sometimes apply that name to me.</p>

<p>Although I found smart repartee,
shot forth from back seats, gave me
glee, still I aspired to climb the tree,
so with restrained temerity I donned a
gown of silk, <i>i.e.</i> became a fully-fledged
K.C. Then, after able A.J.B. was
shunted by his great party and A.B.L.
assumed the see, the latter's finger
beckoned me to face direct the enemy.
Anon the KING created me a member
of his own P.C.</p>

<p>And then "the active life" for me,
as Galloper to "Gen'ral" C., the loyal
Ulsterman, to free from acts of Irish
devilry. I thanked "whatever gods
may be" for training with the Yeomanry!</p>

<p>Then came the war with Germany.
Alas, again I sighed, "Ah me," and
viewed the aspect gloomily, for I was
then in apogee from all that mighty
company that domineered the H. of C.
A. ruled the roast, not A.J.B. But
happy thought, that company of muddlers
held one hope for me&mdash;my constant
pal of Yeomanry, the smashing,
dashing WINSTON C.; result&mdash;the
Censorship for me. But not for long. The
fresh and free and open air was calling
me, so off I went across the sea to join
the fighting soldiery. But soon there
came a call for me, and back I came
across the sea to be His Majesty's
S.-G.</p>

<p>What next was I? Eureka! "<i>The</i>
Right Hon. <i>Sir</i> F.E. SMITH, K.C."</p>

<p>Then came the storm. Sir EDWARD
C. threw up his job and let in me, before
I scarce could laugh, "He, he!" to be
His Majesty's A.-G. That wasn't bad,
I think, for me&mdash;a mild young man of
forty-three!</p>

<p>Next came "the quiet life" for me.
I held my tongue, but drew my fee and
eke my A.-G. salary. Not e'en the great
calamity that overtook A.'s Ministry
and raised the wizard, D.L.G., to
offices of high degree disturbed my
sweet serenity. Nor did I jib when
Sir R.B. FINLAY took on unblushingly
the job that seemed cut out for me.
Unwilling <i>he</i> his weird to dree! <i>I</i>
whispered, "Mum's the word for me!"</p>

<p>Now, after waiting patiently, as fits
a man of my degree, the Woolsack cries
aloud for me, and soft and soothing it
will be to my whole frame and dignity.
And unto those who wish from me to
know what will the ending be of my
august biography, I answer in a minor
key and classic language, "Wait and
see!"</p>

<hr />

<h2>TRANSFORMATION.</h2>

<p>My house, which I am trying to let,
is a modest little affair in the country.
It has a small meadow to the south
and the road to the north. There are
some evergreens about the lawn. The
kitchen garden is large but most
indifferently tended; indeed it is partly
through dissatisfaction with a slovenly
gardener that I decided to leave. The
nearest town is a mile distant; the
nearest station two miles and a half.
We have no light laid on except in a
large room in the garden, where acetylene
gas has been installed.</p>

<p>I am telling you these facts as
concisely as I told them to the agent. He
took them down one by one and said,
"Yes." Having no interest in anything
but the truth, I was as plain with him
as I could be.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "no gas anywhere
but in garden-room."</p>

<p>"Yes, small paddock, about two
acres, to the south."</p>

<p>"Yes, one mile from nearest town."</p>

<p>I was charmed with his easy receptivity
and went away content.</p>

<p>A few days later I received the
description of the house which the agent
had prepared for his clients. Being
still interested in nothing but the truth
I was electrified.</p>

<p>"This very desirable residence," it
began. No great harm in that.</p>

<p>"In heart of most beautiful county
in England," it continued. Nothing
very serious to quarrel with there;
tastes must always differ; but it puts
the place in a new light.</p>

<p>"Surrounded by pleasure-grounds."
Here I was pulled up very short. My
little lawn with its evergreens, my
desolate cabbage-stalks, my tiny
paddock&mdash;these to be so dignified! And
where do the agents get their phrases?
Is there a Thesaurus of the trade,
profession, calling, industry or mystery?
"Garden" is a good enough word for
any man who lives in his house and is
satisfied, but a man who wants a house
can be lured to look at it only if it has
pleasure-grounds: is that the position?
Does an agent in his own home refer
to the garden in that way? If his
wife is named Maud does he sing,
"Come into the pleasure-grounds"?</p>

<p>"Surrounded," too. I was so careful
to say that the paddock and so forth
were on one side and the road on the
other.</p>

<p>I read on: "Situated in the old-world
village of Blank." And I had
been scrupulous in stating that we
were a mile distant&mdash;situated in point
of fact in a real village of our own,
with church, post-office, ancient landau
and all the usual appurtenances. And
"old world"! What is "old world"?
There must be some deadly fascination
in the epithet, for no agent can refrain
from using it; but what does it mean?
Do American agents use it? It could
have had no attraction for COLUMBUS.
Such however is the failure of our
modernity that it is supposed to be
irresistible to-day. And "village!"
The indignation of Blank on finding
itself called an "old world village" will
be something fierce.</p>

<p>None the less, although I was amused
and a little irritated, I must confess to
the dawnings of dubiety as to the
perfect wisdom of leaving such a little
paradise. If it had all this allurement
was I being sensible to let others have
it, and at a time when houses are so
scarce and everything is so costly?
Had I not perhaps been wrong in my
estimate? Was not the sanguine agent
the true judge?</p>

<p>I read on and realised that he was not.
"One mile from Blank station." Such
a statement is one not of critical
appraisement but of fact or falsity. The
accent in which he had said, "Yes,
two and a-half miles from the station,"
was distinct in my ear.</p>

<p>I read further. "Lighted by gas;"
and again I recalled that intelligent
young fellow's bright "Yes, gas only
in the garden-room."</p>

<p>What is one to do with these poets,
these roseate optimists? And how
delightful to be one of them and refuse
to see any but desirable residences and
gas where none is!</p>

<p>But it was the next trope that really
shook me: "Well-stocked kitchen-garden."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>[pg 57]</span>
Here I ceased to be amused
and became genuinely angry. The idea
of calling that wilderness, that monument
of neglect, "well-stocked." I
was furious.</p>

<p>That was a week ago. Yesterday I
paid a flying visit to the country to
see how things were going and how
many people had been to view the place;
and my fury increased when, after again
and for the fiftieth time pointing out
to the gardener the lack of this and
that vegetable, he was more than
normally smiling and silent and dense
and impenitent.</p>

<p>"You say here," he said at last,
pulling the description of the house
from his pocket and pointing to the
words with a thumb as massive as it
is dingy and as dingy as it is massive&mdash;"you say here 'well-stocked kitchen
garden.'" <i>You!</i></p>

<p>And now I understand better the
phrases "agents for good" and "agents
for evil."</p>

<h2>A TRAGEDY OF OVER-EDUCATION.</h2>

<p>It must not be thought that I underestimate
the value of education as a
general principle; indeed I earnestly
beg of Mr. FISHER, should these lines
chance to meet his eye, not to be in
any way discouraged by them; but I
have been driven to the conclusion that
there is such a thing as over-education,
and that it has dangers. When you
have read this story I think you will
agree with me. It is rather a sad
story, but it is very short.</p>

<p>The population of my poultry-yard
was composed of five hens and Umslumpogaas.
The five hens were creatures
of mediocrity, deserving no special
mention&mdash;all very well for laying eggs
and similar domestic duties, but from
an intellectual point of
view simply napoo, as
the polyglot stylists
have it. Far otherwise
was it with Umslumpogaas.
He was a pure
bred, massive Black
Orpington cockerel, a
scion of the finest strain
in the land. Indeed
the dealer from whom
I purchased him informed
me that there
was royal blood in his
veins, and I have no
reason to doubt it. One
had only to watch him
running in pursuit of a
moth or other winged
insect to be struck by
the essentially aristocratic
swing of his
wattles and the symmetrical
curves of his graceful lobes;
and the proud pomposity of his tail
feathers irresistibly called to mind the
old nobility and the Court of LOUIS
QUATORZE. Pimple, our tabby kitten,
looked indescribably bourgeois beside him.</p>

<p>But it was not the external appearance
of Umslumpogaas, regal though
it was, that endeared him to me so
much as his great intellectual potentialities.
That bird had a mind, and I
was determined to develop it to the
uttermost. Under my assiduous tuition
he progressed in a manner that can
only be described as astonishing. He
quickly learned to take a letter from
the post-girl in his beak and deliver it
without error to that member of the
family to whom it was addressed. I
was in the habit of reading to him
extracts from the daily papers, and the
interest he took in the course of the
recent war and his intelligent appreciation
of the finer points of Marshal
FOCH'S strategy were most pleasing to
observe. He would greet the news of
our victorious onsweep with exultant
crows, while at the announcement of
any temporary set-back he would
mutter gloomily and go and scratch
under the shrubbery. On Armistice day
he quite let himself go, cackling and
mafficking round the yard in a manner
almost absurd. But who did not unbend
a little on that historic day?</p>

<p>Perhaps his greatest achievement,
however, was the mastering of a system
of signals, a sort of simplified Morse
code, which we established through the
medium of an old motor-horn. One
blast meant breakfast-time; two intimated
that I was about to dig in the
waste patch under the walnut trees
and he was to assemble his wives for a
diet of worms; three loud toots were
the summons for the mid-day meal;
four were the curfew call signifying that
it was time for him to conduct his
consorts to their coop for the night;
and so on, with special arrangements
in case of air-raids. Not once was
Umslumpogaas at fault; no matter in
what remote corner of the yard he and
his hens might be, at the sound of the
three blasts he would come hastening
up with his hens for dinner. I was
most gratified.</p>

<p>And then came the disaster. I was
sawing wood one morning in the saddle
house, and Umslumpogaas and
his wives were sitting round about the
door, dusting themselves. All was
peaceful. Suddenly down the lane
which passes the gate of my yard appeared
a large grey-bodied car. Some
school-children being in the road the
driver emitted three loud warning hoots
of his horn. In an instant Umslumpogaas
was on his feet and, his wives
at his heels, making a bee line for the
gate. By the time he reached it the
car had passed and was turning the
corner that leads to the village, when
the driver again sounded his horn
thrice. With an imperious call to his
wives to follow, Umslumpogaas set off
at full speed in pursuit, and before I
had fully grasped the situation my
entire poultry-yard had vanished from
sight in the wake of that confounded
motor-car. And it is the unfortunate
truth that neither Umslumpogaas nor
a single member of his harem has been
seen or heard of since. It is as bad as
the affair of the <i>Pied Piper</i> of Hamelin.</p>

<p>I said at the beginning that this was
rather a sad little story. Taking into
consideration the present price of new-laid
eggs it amounts more or less to a
tragedy, and I put it down to nothing
but the baleful effects of over-education.</p>

<h2>THE FINANCIER.</h2>

<p>He had sat at the same table in the
same restaurant for years&mdash;more years
than he cared to count. He was not as
young as be used to be.</p>

<p>Always when he could he sat on the
comfortable sofa-like seat on the wall
side of the table. When that was fully
occupied he sat on the other side on an
ordinary upright chair, in which he
could not lounge at ease.</p>

<p>He sat there now discontentedly,
keeping a watchful eye for vacancies in
the opposite party.</p>

<p>Half-way through his meal a vacancy
occurred. He pushed his plate across
the table and went round, sinking with
a sigh into the cushioned seat.</p>

<p>The departing customer had left the
usual gratuity under the saucer of his
coffee-cup. In a minute or two the
waitress would collect the cup and
saucer and the coins.</p>

<p>But the waitress was busy. The
room was full and there was the usual
deficient service.</p>

<p>He finished eating, lighted a cigarette
and called for a cup of coffee. It was
then, I think, the thought came to him.</p>

<p>The other man's cup, saucer and money
were still there.</p>

<p>His hand fluttered uncertainly over
the cloth among the crockery. There
seemed to be nobody looking. His
fingers slid under the other man's
saucer and in a moment the money was
under his own.</p>

<p>He rose, took his hat and bill and
went.</p>

<p>We left soon after.</p>

<p>"How mean!" said my wife. "Did

<h2>OUR BEAUTY COLUMN.</h2>

<h4>(<i>Latest Style.</i>)</h4>

<p>We four are <i>such</i> friends, Estelle, Rosalie, Beryl and I.
If we weren't could we sit round and say the things to
each other that we do? I ask you.</p>

<p>It's quite a small flat we have, just the one room, but
it's <i>so</i> convenient. There's a chemist's next door, so it's
no walk to get <i>everything</i> we require.</p>

<p>We were sitting round our cosy fireplace, wishing it
were summer or that we had some coal, when one of those
thoughts that make me so loved occurred to me.</p>

<p>"Estelle darling," I asked, though I knew, because the
box was on the mantelpiece; "how <i>do</i> you get that lovely
flush? Your nose is such a <i>delicious</i> tint; it reminds me
of a tomato."</p>

<p>"I owe my colour to my fur coat," replied Estelle
frankly; "you've no idea how warm it keeps me. I
think a natural glow is so much more becoming than
an artificial one."</p>

<p>"By the way, Madge," put in Rosalie (I'm Madge), "as
you've started the game may I ask you a question? How
do you get such a lovely shine on <i>your</i> nose?"</p>

<p>"Chamois leather," I replied sweetly. (You see we're
such friends we love telling each other our boudoir secrets.)</p>

<p>"I wish I knew how you keep those cunning little curls,
Estelle," sighed Beryl longingly. "<i>My</i> hair is so horribly
straight."</p>

<p>"It's quite easy," explained Estelle; "you can do it
with any ordinary flat-iron, though of course an electric-iron
is the best. If you heat the iron over the gas or fire
(if any) it gets sooty, and if you've golden hair, as I
have this year&mdash;well. Only," she went on warningly,
"always see that you lay your curl flat on the table
before you iron it."</p>

<p>"I wish I could get my hands as white as yours, Beryl," I said.</p>

<p>"You can't expect to, darling; working at Whitehall as
you do your fingers are bound to get stained with nicotine.
Warm water and soap is all <i>I</i> use. First I immerse
my hands in tepid water, then I rub the soap (you can
get it at any chemist's or oil-shop) into the pores&mdash;you 'd
be surprised how it lathers if you do it the right way&mdash;and
then I rinse the soap off again. I learnt that trick from
watching our washer-woman&mdash;she had such lovely hands."</p>

<p>"Why do you never use powder now, Estelle?" asked
Rosalie. "Before the War one could never come near you
without leaving footprints."</p>

<p>"My reasons were partly patriotic, conserving the food supply,
you know, and partly owing to the mulatto-like
tint the war-flour gave me. One doesn't want to go about
looking half-baked, does one?"</p>

<p>"No," we murmured, making a pretty concerted number of it.</p>

<p>"But wrinkles, darling Estelle," I pleaded&mdash;"do tell us
what you do for your wrinkles."</p>

<p>"Wrinkles," murmured Estelle, with a pretty puckering
of her brow&mdash;"I haven't any left; I've given them all to you."</p>

<h2>A MILITARY EDUCATIONAL PROBLEM.</h2>

<p>Dear Mr. Punch,&mdash;I write to ask
your advice. As you know, the Army
Council in its wisdom decreed that the
Army, before being demobilised, must
be educated. I have been chosen as
one of the Educators.</p>

<p>My efforts to lead the Army into the
paths of light and learning were crowned
with success until in an evil moment
I undertook to teach Private Goodbody.
This genial ornament of our regimental
sanitary squad is especially anxious to
plumb the mysteries of arithmetic.
When he had, as I thought, finally
mastered the principle that if you borrow
one from the shillings' column you
must pay it back in the pounds' column,
I set him the following sum:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Supposing you owed the butcher
sixteen shillings and three pence halfpenny
and took a pound note to pay
him with, how much change ought he
to give you?"</p>

<p>Private Goodbody scratched his head
for several minutes and at last decided
that he did not know.</p>

<p>"But come, Goodbody," I urged,
"surely it's quite easy." And I repeated
the question.</p>

<p>"I don't know, Sir; I don't never
have no truck with butchers," he declared
emphatically. "I leaves that
'ere to the missus."</p>

<p>"Ah!" I said, "and how does <i>she</i>
get the money to pay him?"</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> gives it 'er," said Goodbody.</p>

<p>"What does she do with the change?" I asked next.</p>

<p>"Gives it back to me, I reck'n," he answered.</p>

<p>"Well," I continued, "if you don't
know how much change there ought
to be when you give her a pound and
she spends sixteen shillings and three
pence halfpenny, how do you know she
gives you back the right amount?"</p>

<p>Private Goodbody eyed me with
something suspiciously like contempt.</p>

<p>"If my missus started playin' any o'
them monkey tricks on me, givin' the
wrong change an' sich, I'd put it acrost
'er," he said.</p>

<p>And there the matter rests for the
present. I feel that I should not lead
Private Goodbody any further into the
intricacies of his subject until he has
solved my problem. This he resolutely
professes himself unable to do, and begs
to be allowed to leave it and plunge
into the giddy vortex of the multiplication table.</p>

<p>Yours faithfully, MENTOR.</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>The day I saw the Wind I stood</p>
<p>All by myself inside our wood,</p>
<p>Where Nurse had told me I must wait</p>
<p>While she went back through the white gate</p>
<p>To fetch her work ... I don't know why,</p>
<p>But suddenly I felt quite shy</p>
<p>With all the trees when Nurse was gone,</p>
<p>For quietness came on and on</p>
<p>And covered me right round as though</p>
<p>I was just nobody, you know,</p>
<p>And not a little girl at all...</p>


<p>But <i>then</i>&mdash;quite sudden&mdash;HER torn shawl</p>
<p>Came through the trees; I saw it gleam,</p>
<p>And SHE was near. Just like a dream</p>
<p>She looked at me. Her lovely hair</p>
<p>Was waving, waving everywhere,</p>
<p>And from her shawl&mdash;all tattery&mdash;</p>
<p>There blew the sweetest scents to me.</p>
<p>I didn't ask her who she was;</p>
<p>I didn't <i>need</i> to ask, because</p>
<p>I <i>knew!</i> ... That's all ... She didn't wait;</p>
<p>She <i>went</i>&mdash;when Nurse called through the gate.</p>

<h2>THE WAR DOGS' PARTY.</h2>

<p>I am a plain dog that barks his mind
and believes in calling a bone a bone,
not one of your sentimental sort that
allows the tail&mdash;that uncontrollable seat
of the emotions&mdash;to govern the head.
I voted Coalition, of course. As a
veteran&mdash;three chevrons and the Croix
de Guerre&mdash;I could hardly refuse to
support the man who above all others
helped us war dogs to beat the Bosch.
But to say that I am satisfied with the
way things are going on&mdash;that's a
mouse of a very different colour, as the
phrase goes. A terrier person who claims
to own the PRIME MINISTER and has
been very busy demanding what he calls
our invaluable suffrages buttonholed
me the other day outside the tripe shop
and commenced to tell me all the wonderful
things that we dogs would get if
we only elected a strong Coalition Government&mdash;better
biscuits, larger kennels,
equal rabbits for all and I don't know
what else. But when I asked him
plainly, "Are you in favour of keeping
out the dachshunds?" the fellow
hedged and said the question was not
so important as some people seemed to
think, and that financial interests had
to be considered.</p>

<p>And that's how the War Dogs' Party
came to be formed, for when they heard
how the land lay some of the influential
dogs in our neighbourhood called a
meeting in Jorrocks' Mews and elected
me chairman. We decided that membership
should not be confined to dogs
who had actually seen service at the
Front, but that any dog who had faced
the trials of the War in the spirit of
true patriotism should be eligible. A
slight difficulty was encountered in the
case of the Irish terrier who owns the
butcher's shop and notoriously has
never been on bone rations, some of
the young hotheads claiming that he
was not eligible. But Snap is a very
popular dog, and when he is not brooding
over his national grievances is a merry
fellow and always ready to share a bone
with a pal. So I ruled that on account
of the historic wrongs of Ireland we
would overlook Snap's defiance of the
Public Bones Order and allow him to be one of us.</p>

<p>One of the first things you learn in
the trenches is the use of tact in coping
with delicate situations. Well, we drew
up a very strong platform and were on
the point of carrying it unanimously
when our secretary, a clever fellow but
temperamental, like all poodles, spotted
the big yellow cat from No. 14 slinking
down the street on some poisonous
errand or other, and the meeting adjourned
in what I can only describe as
a disorderly manner. Of course we are
treating the Declaration of Peace Aims,
as we called it, as carried, though the
secretary insists on adding a fifteenth
point, which he says is of vital importance,
relating to the Declawing of Yellow Cats.</p>

<p>The first plank in our platform is
BRITAIN FOR BRITISH DOGS, which
sounds very well, don't you think?
Sassafras, the Aberdeen terrier from
No. 3, a solid fellow but unimaginative,
wanted it to be ONCE A U-DOG ALWAYS
A U-DOG, but I ruled that that couldn't
be right because once there had been a
U-dog next door to us, but now there
wasn't. Of course they all wanted to
hear about it, but we war dogs are
supposed to be as modest as we are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>[pg 66]</span>
brave, so I simply said that he was
<i>spurlos versenkt</i>. But it isn't only
German dogs we draw the line at.
Take the Pekinese. I've always said
if we didn't combat the Yellow Peril
we'd regret it, and now the pests
are everywhere. My master's woman
has one which she calls Pitti Sing.
Did you ever hear of such a name for a
dog? But then it isn't a dog in the
real sense of the word. Only last
Friday the little beast flew at me&mdash;all
over an absurd chicken bone which
was really meant for me but had been
put on to its plate by mistake&mdash;and
deliberately filled my mouth full of
nasty fluffy fur.</p>

<p>Of course the woman had to come in
at that moment and, instead of chastising
the little monster, she grabbed it
up and hugged it, saying, "Diddums
nasty great dog bite um poor ickle
Pitti Singums?" and a lot more silly
rot equally at variance with the facts.
I wagged my tail at her to show it
wasn't my fault, but she just wouldn't
see reason and told master that I must
have a good whipping. Of course
master and I both know that one isn't
whipped for a little thing like that, so
we retired into the study, and while
master pretended to whip me I pretended
to howl. I was just beginning
to howl in a very lifelike way when the
woman rushed in and called master a
cruel brute, and said she didn't mean
him to hurt me really.</p>

<p>Women are funny creatures and I'm
glad I don't own one. Snap, the butcher's
dog, even went so far as to suggest
that we should adopt anti-feminism
as a plank in our platform, but the Irish
Wolfhound who comes from Cavendish
Square said that his mistress was driving
an ambulance in France and that,
in her absence, anyone who had anything
to say against women would have
to see him first. Of course it's very
difficult to argue with that kind of dog,
and, though Snap seemed inclined to
press the point, I ruled the proposal out
of order. The value of resource is one
of the things you learn in the Army.</p>

<p>I think Snap was rather relieved
really, because after the meeting he
asked me to go and help him dig up a
nearly new mutton bone that he had
buried under a laurel bush in the Square.</p>

<p>Well, to return to our platform, what
we say about these foreign dogs is
"Keep them all out." Of course there
are some Allied dogs, like Poodles and
Plumpuddings and Boston terriers, that
have earned the right to be considered
one of ourselves, but when it comes to
having Mexican Hairless and Schipperkes
and heaven knows what else
coming into the country and taking
the biscuits out of our mouths&mdash;well,
we say it isn't good enough. Not that
we're insular, mind you, but to hear
some of these mangy foreigners talking
about the Brotherhood of Dogs! But
I must tell you how Bolshevism raised
its ugly head in our midst. It was
while we were discussing the second
plank in our platform, which is "DOGS,
NOT DOORMATS."</p>

<p>But there, Master is calling me to
take him for a walk, so it must wait
till next week.    ALGOL.</p>

<h2>NEW BOOKS</h2>

<h3>FROM MESSRS. TRUEMAN AND WASHINGTON'S LIST.</h3>

<h3><i>THE ZOOMERS.</i></h3>

<h4>By GLADYS WANK.</h4>

<h4><i>Price</i> 6/11¾.</h4>

<p>A new writer who by virtue of her godlike
genius takes her seat with HOMER,
DANTE, SHAKSPEAKE and MARIE CORELLI,
and a novel such as the world has not known
since <i>The Miseries of Mephistopheles</i> startled
the comatose mid-Victorians from their
slumbers&mdash;both stand revealed in these soul-shaking
pages. To say that this is the
novel of the year is to malign its greatness
It is the novel of the century, of all centuries,
of all time.</p>

<h4>FIRST REVIEW BEFORE PUBLICATION.</h4>

<blockquote><p>
"It is not saying too much, when I
solemnly assert that I really believe that
Miss Wank's first book is the best she has

</p></blockquote>

<hr class="short" />

<h3><i>SIMIAN SONGS.</i></h3>

<h4>BY ISABEL MUNKITTRICK.</h4>

<h4><i>Price</i> 11/3½.</h4>

<p>These remarkable lyrics are translations
into vernacular verse of the prose versions
of specimens of the literature of the great
apes of Africa, collected by Professor GARNER.
It is not too much to say that those touching
<i>cris de coeur</i> redolent of the jungle, the
lagoon and the hinterland, will appeal with
irresistible force to all lovers of sincere and
passionate emotion. The Chimpanzee's
"swing song" on page 42 is a marvel of
oscillating melody.</p>

<h3><i>THE MILLENNIUM viâ ARMAGEDDON.</i></h3>

<h4>BY REV. ANGUS WOTTLEY, D.D.</h4>

<h4><i>With a Foreword by</i> PRINCIPAL CAWKER.</h4>

<h4><i>Price</i> 9/4¼.</h4>

<p>This is a work of over 120,000 words of
extraordinary beauty and distinction. It
has gone into 150 editions in Patagonia,
where the editions are very large, and ought
to be in great demand in this country.
Tiberius Mull, writing in the Literary Supplement
of <i>The Scottish Oil World</i>, uses
these remarkable words: "I do honestly
believe that Dr. Angus Wottley's book is
the most weighty volume he has ever given
to the world."</p>

<hr class="short" />

<h3><i>POLLY ANDREA'S SACRIFICE.</i></h3>

<h4>By SALINA LAKE.</h4>

<h4><i>Price</i> 8/3½.</h4>

<p>This is the first attempt to present the
limitations of the modern monogamous
system in its true polyphonic perspective,
several huge editions having been exhausted
before publication. Professor McTalisker
writes in the Theological Supplement of
<i>John Bull</i>: "For a person in a state of
partial exhaustion I can imagine no more
efficacious stimulant than is to be found
in those beautiful pages. Not being
acquainted with any of the earlier works of
the author, I can honestly declare that in
my opinion it is the best thing that I have
read from her pen, and, further, that it has
made a deeper impression upon me than
any other work which I have not read but
which deals with the same subject."</p>

<h2>THE MUD LARKS.</h2>

<p>I met a man in the Club at Lille the
other day who told me that he knew
all about women. He had studied the
subject, he said, and could read 'em like
an open book. He admitted that it
took a bit of doing, but that once you
had the secret they would trot up and
eat out of your hand.</p>

<p>Having thus spoken he swallowed
three whiskies in rapid succession and
rushed away to jump a lorry-ride to
Germany, and I have not seen him
since, much to my regret, for I need
his advice, I do.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>We splashed into the hamlet of
Sailly-le-Petit at about eight o'clock of
a pouring dark night, to find the inhabitants
abed and all doors closed upon us.</p>

<p>However, by dint of entreaties whispered through
key-holes and persuasions cooed under window-shutters,
I charmed most of them open again and got
my troop under cover, with the exception of one section.
Its Corporal, his cape spouting like a miniature watershed,
swam up. "There's a likely-lookin' farm over
yonder, Sir," said he, "but the old gal won't let us in.
She's chattin' considerable." I found a group of
numb men and shivering horses standing knee-deep
in a midden, the men exchanging repartee with a
furious female voice that shrilled at them from a
dark window. "Is that the officer?" the voice demanded. I admitted as
much. "Then remove your band of brigands. Go home to England, where
you belong, and leave respectable people in peace. The War is finished."</p>

<p>I replied with some fervour (my boots were full of water and my cap dribbling
pints of iced-water down the back of my neck) that I was not playing the
wandering Jew round one-horse Picard villages in late December for the amusement
I got out of it and that I could be relied on to return to England at the
earliest opportunity, but for the present moment would she let us in out of the
downpour, please? The voice soared to a scream. No, she would not, not
she. If we chose to come soldiering we must take the consequences, she
had no sympathy for us. She called several leading saints to witness that
her barn was full to bursting anyhow and there was no room. That was
that. She slammed the window-shutter and retired, presumably to bed.
The Corporal, who had been scouting round about, returned to report room for all hands
in the barn, which was quite empty. Without further ado I pushed all hands
into the barn and left them for the night.</p>

<p>Next morning, while walking in the village street, I beheld a remarkable
trio approaching. It consisted of a venerable cleric&mdash;his skirts held high
enough out of the mud to reveal the
fact that he favoured flannel underclothing
and British army socks&mdash;and
a massive rustic dressed principally in
hair, straw-ends and corduroys. The
third member was a thick short bulldog
of a woman, who, from the masterly
way in which she kept corduroys from
slipping into the village smithy and
saved the cleric from drifting to a
sailor's grave in the duck-pond, seemed
to be the controlling spirit of the party.
By a deft movement to a flank she
thwarted her reluctant companions in
an attempt to escape up a by-way,
and with a nudge here and a tug there
brought them to a standstill in front of
me and opened the introductions.</p>

<p>"M. le Curé," indicating the cleric,
who dropped his skirts and raised his
beaver.</p>

<p>"M. le Maire," indicating corduroys,
who clutched a handful of straw out of
his beard and groaned loudly.</p>

<p>"<i>Moi, je suis Madame, Veuve Palliard-Dubose</i>,"
indicating herself.</p>

<p>I bowed, quailing inwardly, for I
recognized the voice. She gave corduroys
a jab in the short ribs with her
elbow. "<i>Eh bien</i>, now speak."</p>

<p>Corduroys rolled his eyes like a
driven bullock, sneezed a shower of
straw and groaned again.</p>

<p>"<i>Imbécile!</i>" spat Madame disgustedly and prodded the Curé. But the Curé
was engaged in religious exercises, beads flying through his fingers, lips
moving, eyes tight closed. Madame shrugged her shoulders eloquently as if
to say, "Men&mdash;what worms! I ask you," and turned on me herself. She
led off by making some unflattering guesses as to my past career, commented
forcibly on my present mode of life, ventured a few cheerful prophecies
as to my hereafter and polished
off a brisk ten minutes heart-to-heart
talk by snapping her fingers under my
nose and threatening me with the guillotine
if I did not instantly remove my
man-eating horses from her barn.</p>

<p>"Observe," she concluded triumphantly,
"I have the Church and State
on my side."</p>

<p>"Have you?" I queried. "Have you? Look again."</p>

<p>She turned to the right for the Mayor, but a strong
trail of straw running up the by-way told that that
massive but inarticulate dignitary had slunk home to
his threshing. She turned to the left for the Curé, but
the whisk of a skirt and a flannel shank disappearing
into the church-porch showed that the discreet
clerk had side-stepped for sanctuary. I thought it
kinder to leave Madame the widow Palliard-Dubose to
herself at this juncture, but something told me I had not
heard the last of her. Nor had I. A week later an imposing
document was forwarded from the orderly-room
for my "information and necessary
action, please." It emanated from the
French Military Mission and claimed
from me the modest sum of two thousand
three hundred and fourteen francs
on behalf of one Madame Veuve Palliard-Dubose,
of the village of Sailly-le-Petit,
Pas de Calais, the claimant alleging
that my troopers had stolen unthreshed
wheat to that value wherewith
to feed their horses. A prompt settlement
would oblige.</p>

<p>I fled panic-stricken down to stables and wagged the document in the faces
of the thieves. They were virtuously indignant; hadn't pinched no wheat-straw
at all&mdash;not in Sailly-le-Petit. Might have been a bit absent-minded-like at
Auchy-en-Artois, and again at Pressy-aux-Bois mistakes may have been
made, but here never&mdash;no, Sir, s'welp-them-Gawd. I wrote to the French
Mission denying the impeachment. They replied with a fresh shower of
claims. I answered with a storm of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>[pg 69]</span>
denials. The sky snowed correspondence. Just when the French were
putting it all over me and my orderly-room was hinting that I had best pay
up and save the Entente Cordiale, the French ran out of paper and sent one
of their missionaries in a car to settle the matter verbally. I gave him a
good lunch, an excellent cigar and spread all the facts of the case before
him as one human to another. He spent an hour nosing about the village,
and the result of his investigations was that Madame Veuve Palliard-Dubose,
so far from having her wheat stolen, had had no wheat to steal, and furthermore
never in the course of her agricultural activities had she harvested
crops to the value of Francs 2314. Virtue triumphant. Evil vanquished.
Madame the widow Palliard-Dubose retired grimly into her cabin, slamming
the door on the world.</p>

<p>Yesterday was New Year's Day. Imagine my surprise when, on visiting
the horses at mid-day, Madame Veuve Palliard-Dubose leaned over the half-door
of her dwelling and waved her hand to me. "<i>Ah, ha, Monsieur le
Lieutenant</i>", she crowed, "many felicitations
on this most auspicious day! <i>Bon jour, belle année</i>!"</p>

<p>I was so staggered I treated her to
my <i>perfecto superfino</i>, my very best
salute (usually reserved for Generals
and Field Cashiers). "The same to you,
Madame, and many of 'em. <i>Vive la France!</i>"</p>

<p>Madame bowed and smiled with all
her features. "<i>Vive l'Angleterre</i>!"
What a lot of weather we were having,
weren't we? and what a glorious victory
it had been, hadn't it?&mdash;mainly due
to the dear soldiers, she felt sure. She
hoped I found myself enjoying robust health.</p>

<p>I replied that I was in the pink myself and trusted she was the same.</p>

<p>Never pinker in her life, she said;
everything was perfectly lovely. She
beckoned me nearer. She had a small
favour to ask. At this season of peace
and goodwill would the so amiable
Lieutenant deign to enter her modest
abode and take a little glass of <i>vin
blanc</i> with her?</p>

<p>The "amiable Lieutenant" would be enchanted.</p>

<p>She swung the door open and bowed
me in. The glasses were already filled
and waiting on the table&mdash;a big one
for me, a little one for her.</p>

<p>We clicked rims and lifted our elbows
to the glorious victory, to the weather
(which was rotten) and our mutual
pinkness.</p>

<p>"<i>A votre santé, mon Lieutenant</i>!"
crooned Madame the widow Palliard-Dubose.</p>

<p>"<i>À votre, Madame</i>," replied her Lieutenant,
quaffing the whole issue in one
motion. Paraffin, ladies and gentlemen,
pure undiluted paraffin&mdash;paugh! wow! ouch!</p>

<h2>THE LINGUIST.</h2>

<p>Nancy is eleven and thinks I know everything. I never
could resist or contradict her.</p>

<p>"Now tell me about animals in Africa," she said. "Tell me lots."</p>

<p>This was better than usual, for I possess a heavily-mortgaged
and drought-stricken farm in some obscure
corner of that continent and have spent much time disputing
with beasts who refused to acknowledge my proprietary claims.</p>

<p>So I told Nancy tales of lions that roared till the stars
tumbled out of the sky with fright, and, when she crept
very close to me, of the blue monkeys with funny old faces
who swung through the trees and across the river-bed to
steal my growing corn. I told her of the old ones who
led them in the advance and followed in the retreat, chattering
orders, and of the little babies who clung to their
mothers. I told her that monkeys elected not to talk lest
they should be made to work, but that there were a few
men living who understood their broken speech and could
hold communion with them.</p>

<p>She led me on with little starts and questions and&mdash;well,
I may all unwillingly have misled her as to my general
intelligence.</p>

<p>"We'll go to the Zoo to-morrow," Nancy commanded,
"and you can talk to the monkeys and find out what they
think. Let's."</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Nancy shook her curls and turned her back on the patient-looking
bear.</p>

<p>"He's stupid," she said. "Why can't you find the
monkeys? You know you promised."</p>

<p>I suggested luncheon, but was overruled, and, on turning
a corner, read my fate in large letters on the opposite
building.</p>

<p>"Come on," said Nancy, taking me by the hand.</p>

<p>Her first selection was very old and melancholy. He
accepted a piece of locust-bean with leisurely condescension
and watched us with quiet interest as he chewed. He
rather frightened me; the wisdom of all the ages was
behind his wrinkled eyes.</p>

<p>"When you were in your prison did the Germans feed
you through the bars?" Nancy asked with great clearness.</p>

<p>Several people in the vicinity became aware of our existence
and, feeling the limelight upon me, I again mentioned
the lateness of the hour.</p>

<p>"Talk to him," she said. "Ask him what it's like in
there."</p>

<p>I treated the blinking monkey to a collection of clicks
and chuckles which would have startled even a professor
of the Bantu languages. He finished his bean and emitted
a low bird-like call.</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked Nancy.</p>

<p>"You see," I said, "he's brown and comes from a different
part of the country. It's like Englishmen and
Frenchmen. Now, if he was blue&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ask that keeper," said Nancy.</p>

<p>"He's very busy," I whispered. "We oughtn't to interrupt
him."</p>

<p>Nancy at once ran over to the man.</p>

<p>"Have you got any blue ones?" she asked. "'Cos <i>he</i>
can talk to them. We'd like to see one."</p>

<p>The man looked at me without interest. I was an
amateur and a rival; but Nancy's smile can work wonders.</p>

<p>"Yes, Missy," he said, "a beauty round here."</p>

<p>We reached the cage all too soon.</p>

<p>"Now talk," Nancy ordered.</p>

<p>Again I went through my ridiculous performance. The
monkey looked at the keeper.</p>

<p>The hand which lay in mine told me that Nancy's confidence
was waning. I knew then how much I valued it.</p>

<p>"Not very well, is he?" I asked of the keeper. "A little
out of sorts&mdash;this weather, you know."</p>

<p>My reputation was in his hands, but I dared make no
sign. Nancy's eyes were on my face.</p>

<p>The man looked at me and then at the eager little face
below him. "Heavy cold, Sir," he said stolidly. "Always
makes 'em a bit hard o' hearing. Poor old Topsy! Want
to be left alone, do you?"</p>

<p>"What a pity," said Nancy. "Mother <i>will</i> be sorry to
hear that the only one you could speak to was so ill and
deaf."</p>

<p>"What were you giving him?" she asked as we walked
away.</p>

<p>"Only a little New Year present for his children," I said.</p>

<p>"How do you know he's got any children?" Nancy
demanded. "He didn't say so, did he?"</p>

<p>"No, but I'm quite certain he has," I answered.</p>

<hr />

<p>Letter received by an officer in Egypt:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"Sir I have the honour and the opportunity to write you a letter

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<h4>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</h4>

<p>I wonder if I am alone in a feeling of impatience and
bewilderment over what I may call half-fairy stories.
Magic I understand and love; but this now diluted form of
it leaves me cold. Take for example the book that has
occasioned this complaint, <i>The Curious Friends</i> (ALLEN AND
UNWIN), an unconventional and perhaps just a little
silly tale about a secret association of children and grownups,
pledged to mutual help and a variety of altruistic
aims&mdash;a scheme, with all its faults, at least human and
understandable. But Miss C.J. DELAGREVE has chosen to
complicate it by (apparently) a dash of the supernatural,
in the person of a character called <i>Saint Ken</i>, about whom
we are told that he lived in a tunnel on the Underground
and employed himself in helping distressed passengers.
Well, what I in my brutal way want to know is whether
this is a joke, or what. Because if I have to credit it, over
goes the rest of the plot into frank make-believe. And
fantasy of this kind consorts but ill with a scheme that
embraces such realities as heart-failure and typhus. Not
in any case that Miss DELAGEEVE'S plot could be called
exactly convincing. "Preposterous" would be the apter word
for this society of the Blue-Bean Wearers, in which vague
elderly persons wandered about with sadly self-conscious
children and talked like the dialogue in clever books. This
at least was the impression conveyed to me. I may add
that I was continually aware of a certainty that Miss
DELAGREVE will do very much better when she selects a
simpler and less affected subject.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>In <i>Douglas Jerrold</i> (HODDER AND STOUGHTON) Mr.
WALTER JERROLD has executed a pious task. He has
written the life of his grandfather, and has done it with
great enthusiasm. The work is in two volumes, one
thick and the other thin, and sometimes I cannot help
feeling that one volume, the thin one, would have been
enough. DOUGLAS JERROLD'S reputation depends upon his
work in <i>Punch</i> and his writing of plays, of which nearly
seventy stand to his credit. To <i>Punch</i> he contributed from
the second number and soon became a power by means
of "Mrs. Caudle's Curtain Lectures," "The Story of a
Feather" and countless other articles which suited the
taste of the public of that day. Of his work for <i>Punch</i>
there is only the barest mention in this book, for that story
has already been told at some length by the same author.
In the present book Mr. WALTER JERROLD devotes a large
amount of space to a review of DOUGLAS JERROLD'S theatrical
pieces. Where now is a five-act comedy, entitled
<i>Bubbles of the Day</i>, which at the time of its production
was described as "one of the wittiest and best constructed
comedies in the English language"? I am afraid that
this comedy, and even <i>Black-eyed Susan</i>, JERROLD'S greatest
triumph, have passed away into the limbo of forgotten
plays and can never return to us. Another drama had in
it as one of the characters "a certain cowardly English
traveller named Luckless Tramp," a name, I should have
thought, quite sufficient in itself to swamp every possible
chance of success; yet our forefathers seem to have had
no difficulty in accommodating themselves to it.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>In an author's note to <i>Moon of Israel</i> (MURRAY) Sir H.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>[pg 72]</span>
RIDER HAGGARD tells us that his book "suggests that the
real Pharaoh of the Exodus was not Meneptah or Merenptah,
son of Rameses the Great, but the mysterious usurper,
Amenmeses ..." I am not a student of Egyptology, and
in this little matter of AMENMESES am perfectly content to
trust myself to Sir RIDER, and, provided that he tells a good
tale, to follow him wherever he chooses to lead the way.
And this story, put into the mouth of <i>Ana</i>, the scribe, is
packed with mystery and magic and miracles and murder.
For fear, however, that this may sound a little too exhausting
for your taste, let me add that the main theme is the
love of the <i>Crown Prince of Egypt</i> for the Israelite, <i>Lady
Merapi, Moon of Israel</i>. Sir RIDER'S hand has lost none of
its cunning, and, though his dialogue occasionally provokes
a smile when one feels that seriousness is demanded, he is
here as successful as ever in creating or, at any rate, in
reproducing atmosphere. I hope, when you read this tale
of the Pharaohs, that you will not find that your memory of
the Book of Exodus is as faded as I found mine to be.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Mr. CHRISTOPHER CULLEY, whom you may remember for
a bustling, rather cinematic story called <i>Naomi of the
Mountains</i>, has now followed this with another, considerably
better. <i>Lily of the Alley</i> (CASSELL) is, in spite of a title
of which I cannot too strongly disapprove, as successful a
piece of work of its own kind as anyone need wish for, showing
the author to have made a notable advance in his art.
Again the setting is Wild West, on the Mexican border, the
theme of the tale being the outrages inflicted upon American
citizens by VILLA, and what seemed then the bewildering
delay of Washington over the vindication of the flag.
The "Alley" of its unfortunate name is the slum in Kansas
City where <i>Dave</i>, stranded on his way westward, met the
girl to whom the laws of fiction were inevitably to join
him. I fancy that one of Mr. CULLEY'S difficulties may
have lain in the fact that, when the tale, following <i>Dave</i>,
had finally shaken itself from the dust of cities, the
need for feminine society was conspicuously less urgent.
Even after a rescued and refreshed <i>Lily</i> is brought up-country,
she is kept, so to speak, as long as possible at
the base, and only arrives on the actual scene of <i>Dave's</i>
activities in time to be bustled hurriedly out of the way of
the final (and wonderfully thrilling) chapters. The explanation
is, I think, that the cowboy, whom he knows so well,
is for Mr. CULLEY hero and heroine too. <i>Dave</i>, round
whom the story revolves, is a pleasant study of a type of
American youth which we are coming gratefully to estimate
at its true worth; but in the development of the theme
<i>Dave</i> soon becomes almost insignificant beside the greater
figure of the cowboy, <i>Monte Latarette</i>. For him alone I
should regard the book as one not to be missed by anyone
who values a handling of character at once delicate and
masterful.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><i>Keeling Letters and Recollections</i> (ALLEN AND UNWIN) is
a book that will perhaps rouse varied emotions in those
who read it. Regret there will be for so much youth and
intellectual vigour sacrificed; admiration for courage and
for a patriotism that circumstances made by no means the
simple matter of conviction that it has been for most; and
vehement opposition to many of the views (on the War
especially) held by the subject of the memoir. By sympathy
and environment KEELING was, to begin with, a wholehearted
admirer of Germany. Strangely, in one of his
social views, he carried this admiration even to the extent of
advocating a Teutonic control that should include Holland.
To such a mind the outbreak of war with Germany may well
have seemed the last horror. But he admitted no choice.
Within a few days he was a private soldier; he was killed,
as sergeant-major, while bombing a trench on August 18,
1916. The spirit in which he entered the War is shown in
an extract from a letter: "What we have got to do in the interest
of Europe is to fight Germany without passion, with
respect." How grimly those last two words sound now!
Through everything KEELING held with a generous obstinacy
to his original prejudices. Germany remained most tragically
his second fatherland. Somewhere he writes, "I expect I
shall be a stronger Pacifist after the war than any of the
people who are Pacifists now. But I don't feel one will have
earned the right to be one <i>unless one has gone in with
the rest</i>." The italics are mine. Before a vindication
so unanswerable criticism has no further word to say.</p>

the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
